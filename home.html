    <h1 class="h">HISTORY</h1>
    <h2 class="h">MUGHAL EMPIRE</h2>
	<p class="p">
		Under the Mughal Empire, policing was organized on the basis of land tenure. Zamindars were responsible for apprehending disturbers of the public peace and performing other policing duties. At the village level, these functions were performed by the village headman. In large towns, functionaries known as kotwals combined law enforcement, municipal administration and revenue collection. Watchmen were on patrol and violent, organized crime was usually handled by the military.
	</p>
	<h2 class="h">BRITISH RAJ</h2>
	<p class="p">The modern system of policing was introduced during British rule. The British administration relieved the zamindars of responsibility for police service, and introduced magistrates with daroghas and other subordinate officers. The Punjab Police was organized in two branches: the Military Preventive Police and the Civil Detective Police. This arrangement proved unsatisfactory, however, and the government of British India urged the government of Punjab to investigate the province's system of policing in 1860. Due to the importance of the issue, the central government appointed a commission to investigate policing in British India. The Calcutta Police Commission of 1860 recommended abolition of the police's military arm, the appointment of an Inspector General of Police in the province and the supervision of police in a district by a District Superintendent. The commission recommended that only the district magistrate should conduct law-enforcement functions. Based on the commission's recommendations, the government of India submitted a bill which was enacted as Act V of 1861; the Police Act of 1861 was adopted. The organizational structure of the act still survives.The Punjab Police Rules of 1933 documented the police practices of the time, and introduced measures for improving administration and operational effectiveness. The rules indicate that the Punjab Police was a professional police organization by 1934, had considerable knowledge of the province's crime and criminals, and developed effective procedures and practices for dealing with various kinds of criminal activity. The force's administrative and disciplinary functions were also described. They have been the model for similar rules in other provinces of Pakistan, and are still in force.</p>
	<h2 class="h">ORGANIZATION</h2>
	<p class="p">The Punjab Police is constituted by the Police Order 2002 and operates under the Police Rules of 1934. The Central Police Office (CPO) in Lahore which has a number of branches, including the Legal Affairs Division (Legal Branch), Finance and Welfare, Operations, Training, and Research and Development. The branches report to the Inspector General of Police through their Additional Inspectors General of Police. The Regional Police Officers report to the Inspector General of Police, and are not part of the Punjab CPO. The Inspector General of Police is the ex officio secretary of the government of Punjab. The Punjab Police is staffed by its officers and those of the Police Service of Pakistan.</p>
